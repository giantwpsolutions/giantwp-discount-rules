== Description ==

Running flash sales manually? Struggling with complex discount scenarios? Losing sales because your pricing isn't flexible enough?

**GiantWP Discount Rules** solves all of that.

This is the WooCommerce discount plugin that finally makes sense. No PhD required. No confusing settings buried five levels deep. Just smart, flexible discount rules that work the way you think.

Want to reward bulk buyers? Done. Need to run a "Buy 2 Get 1 Free" promotion? Easy. Want to give VIP customers 15% off everything? Set it up in 30 seconds. Need to discount specific categories only when cart total exceeds $100? We've got you covered.

**The best part?** Everything happens automatically. No coupon codes for customers to remember or type in. Your discounts just work, applying themselves when conditions are met and disappearing when they're not.

== Why Store Owners Love This Plugin ==

**It's Actually Simple**
Most discount plugins feel like you need an engineering degree. Not this one. We built it with a clean, modern interface that just makes sense. Create a rule, set your conditions, choose your discount. Done.

**It's Powerful (When You Need It)**
Simple doesn't mean limited. Behind that clean interface is a seriously powerful engine. Want to create a discount that only applies to returning customers who buy from specific categories on Tuesdays when their cart exceeds $75? Yeah, you can do that.

**It Doesn't Break Your Site**
We're obsessed with performance. The plugin is built with Vue.js for a lightning-fast admin experience, and the frontend code is optimized to not slow down your store. Fast plugin = fast store = happy customers.

**It Actually Helps You Sell More**
This isn't just about offering discounts. It's about strategic pricing that increases conversions. Show customers exactly how much they'll save. Display "Buy 2 Get 20% Off" right on the product page. Watch your average order value climb.

== Real-World Examples ==

Let me show you how this works in practice:

**Example 1: Encourage Bulk Orders**
"Buy 5 or more of any product, get 15% off your entire order"
→ Set up a simple cart quantity condition with percentage discount
→ Customers automatically see the discount when they hit 5 items

**Example 2: Reward Loyal Customers**
"Returning customers who've spent $500+ get 10% off everything"
→ Create a rule with purchase history condition
→ Applies automatically when they log in

**Example 3: Category Flash Sale**
"All shoes 25% off this weekend only"
→ Set category discount with scheduled start/end dates
→ Automatically activates Friday at midnight, deactivates Sunday at 11:59 PM

**Example 4: Wholesale Pricing**
"Wholesale customers get 30% off all orders over $200"
→ Combine user role condition with cart subtotal
→ Only wholesale customers see the pricing

**Example 5: Classic BOGO**
"Buy 2 pairs of jeans, get 1 free"
→ Set up BOGO rule for jeans category
→ Free item automatically added to cart

== Available Conditions (Mix and Match) ==

**Cart Conditions**
* Cart subtotal (before discounts)
* Total cart quantity
* Cart weight

**Product Conditions**
* Specific products
* Product variations
* Categories

**Customer Conditions**
* Logged in status
* User role
* Specific customers
* New vs. returning

**Purchase History**

Nope! That's the beauty of this plugin. Discounts apply automatically when conditions are met. No coupon codes to remember, copy, or type in. It just works.
